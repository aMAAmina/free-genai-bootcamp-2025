# Functional Requirements
This project focuses on building an intelligent language learning system using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Language Learning Models (LLMs). The system is designed to provide contextually accurate language lessons and sentence construction exercises.

# Non-functional Requirements
The goal is to create a system that can assist users in learning a new language in a dynamic and interactive manner. The challenge is to make this work efficiently on both local and cloud infrastructure, using limited resources.

# Constraints
Limited Hardware Capacity:
The current hardware setup, an Intel i5 processor with 8GB of RAM, is not ideal for running large Generative AI (GenAI) models efficiently.

# Risks
Cloud costs may vary depending on usage patterns, model size, and the frequency of requests.

# Data Strategy
As the project involves user interactions and data storage (e.g., user queries, generated content), ensuring data privacy and compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR) could be a concern, especially when using cloud-based services or third-party APIs. Proper measures will need to be taken to protect user data and maintain confidentiality.

# Governance and Security
Access Control and Authentication:
To prevent unauthorized access, the system will need a robust authentication mechanism to verify users and control access to specific resources.
Security Best Practices:
To prevent vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).
